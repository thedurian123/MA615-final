# MA615-final
For the eda part, I use lines.txt to do it. This is very small and easy I think it will save my time to do the shiny work. I make the plot to show line_sort_order different and use line_color to distinction them. The idea is I can use this line data add to the map, so when I do the shiny work, the map will also show the line information and the color. The biggest problem is in the stop.txt data. As request, shiny application should allow the user to examine the travel time between stops on MBTA services. The stop data is very large and hard to do the clean work because it is all txt file. After I finish that, I find I cant find a right way to add these information in to map like point the time line when it start and when it stop when I pick the place. I can add the map like shows MBTA line information, but I did not know how to add more information on that. Meanwhile, the line data is not that easily to add to shiny as I used thinking.
